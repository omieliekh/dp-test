            <h3>Used technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AngularJS
            <li>Angular UI Router
            <li>RequireJS
            <li>NPM
            <li>Grunt
            <li>LESS
            <li>Highcharts-ng and Highcharts
        </ul>
        <h3>Tricks</h3>
        <p>To make AMD approach really work, we need to trigger module loading exactly before showing its page.</p>
        <p>Also none of module's files should be loaded before that.</p>
        <p>So, I've implemented advanced route processing.</p>
        <p>Angular allows us to wait for promise dependencies to be resoled</p>
        <p>So module's files was defined as dependencies for module's route and magic happened :)</p>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>For charts, <strong>highcharts-ng</strong> directive wrapper was used.</p>
        <p>CSS was compiled with help of LESS compiler.</p>
        <p>To simplify development, Grunt build manager was used with <strong>grunt-contrib-less</strong> to run LESS</p>
        <p>and <strong>grunt-contrib-watch</strong> to automatically recompile CSS on every less-file change</p>
